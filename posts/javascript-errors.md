There are three main types of errors in JavaScript:

1. Syntax Errors
2. Runtime Errors
3. Logical Errors

## **Syntax Errors**

Syntax errors, also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript.

Syntax errors occur when the structure of one of your JavaScript statements violates the grammar of the JavaScript language.

## **Runtime Errors**

Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation). These errors are usually caused by unanticipated circumstances that cause your program to behave in an unexpected way.

For example, if you are trying to access an element in an array that does not exist, you will get a runtime error.

## **Logical Errors**

Logical errors are the hardest to find and fix. These errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error, but rather, the result of incorrect logic being used in your code.

For example, if you are trying to find the average of a list of numbers and your code incorrectly adds the numbers instead of averaging them, you have a logical error.

Logical errors can be the most difficult to find because there is often no obvious indication that something is wrong.
