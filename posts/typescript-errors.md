There are a few common errors that you might encounter when working with TypeScript.

Here are some of the most common ones:

## `• Cannot find name 'x'`

This error occurs when the TypeScript compiler can't find the name of a variable or object that you're trying to use.

This can be caused by a typo, or by not importing the required module.

## `• Property 'x' does not exist on type 'y'`

This error occurs when you're trying to access a property or method on an object that doesn't have that property or method. This can be caused by a typo, or by using the wrong type of object.

## `• Argument of type 'x' is not assignable to parameter of type 'y'`

This error occurs when you're trying to pass an argument to a function that is of the wrong type. This can be caused by a typo, or by passing the wrong type of object.

## `• Type 'x' is not assignable to type 'y'`

This error occurs when you're trying to assign a value to a variable that is of the wrong type. This can be caused by a typo, or by using the wrong type of object.

## `• Cannot use 'x' as a type`

This error occurs when you're trying to use a variable as a type. This can be caused by a typo, or by using the wrong type of object.
